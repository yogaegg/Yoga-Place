**Graduate Teaching Assistant:**

> Identified and built more than 8 assignments and answer keys with the instructor

> Performed reviews and graded assignments and tests. 

> Coordinated and participated in twice weekly office hours for undergraduate students, recorded student feedback and conveyed to the instructor. 

> Streamlined communications with over 60 students from classes of 4 sections and assisted them in resolving issues. 

**Data Analyst** :

> Utilized SQL to filter and summarize rental data and maintain database systems

> Used Python scripts to cleanse public apartment rental data and in New York tri-state area.

> interpret trends of rental pricing and aligned objectives with a range of clients to gather and collate relevant data to facilitate ongoing analytical operations.

> Performed complex cost analysis of leasing plans gaining valuable findings. 

> Authored reports for senior management offering recommendations informed by cost analysis     insights. 

Academic Projects
--------------------

---

**Thesis Project: Crowdsourcing Binary Label with Variational Autoencoder**

> Designed a machine learning probabilistic graphical variational     autoencoder model to predict true label of three set of binary label data from crowdsourcing raw data from Amazon Mturk.

> Applied TensorFlow with customized neural network structure with various optimization functions and maintained performance with less complex structure.

> Increased the accuracy of three dataset by 1% by adjusting cost functions by applying SGD (stochastic gradient descent) and annealing. 

**Generating Human Face with GANs**

> Designed a GAN model to generate new human faces not in reality from random noises  and a set of real celebrities’ faces.

> Applied TensorFlow in Python to train the data from randomly selected instances from CelebA dataset.

> Achieved Goals with less than 60 epochs with shallow neural network structure and reduced the training time from over 10 hours to 7 hours with image pre-processing and a GPU-driven PC. 

**Covid tracking Android application**

> Built an android app that uses geofence, Google APIs to track activities of user when going to different places.

> Uploaded data to MySQL server such that personal private information can be shared by user’s consent. 

> Customized users’ preference according to their need and designed a distributed system to  accommodate government’s needs to read and achieve data.

> Build up web services with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for individual users of their activities so that dataset can be sharable 

**Information flow and leaks on popular apps**

> Constructed Functions calls flows of Android application from decompilers and Android manifest files.

> Built up information flows with specialized data structure in C and output graph of flows to stakeholders.

> Identified information flow and leaks with JAVA pretrained structures and create complex solutions for users to protect sensitive information.

**Building Chat application over TCP and UDP protocol network**

> Built chat application between peer-to-peer ports with socket communication

> Utilized multi-threading to solve the problem of multiple clients online at the same time to avoid no reply

> Improve the safety of network by applying TCP handshake paradigm after the application built

 **Default Prediction Using Machine Learning**                                                                                                                                              

> Designed a machine learning model predicting recommendation decision according to the limited view and card fraud history of the users 

> Applied scikit-learn in Python to train the data from randomly selected instances from the data

> Compared the results of the aggregating model and the individual results in decision tree and logistic regression model, plotted the decision boundary and the training instances for each individual scenario and the aggregating
